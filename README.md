# Task Manager Project

## Overview
This project implements a multi-threaded task manager in C++. The task manager allows concurrent execution of tasks while managing resources effectively. It demonstrates key concepts of multi-threading, synchronization, and deadlock management.

## Features
- Concurrent execution of multiple tasks utilizing C++ threads.
- Resource protection using mutex locks.
- Demonstration of deadlock scenarios and their resolution strategies.

## Requirements
- C++11 or later
- A compatible C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`)
- To compile and run on a Linux-based environment (or Windows Subsystem for Linux).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ffrunner/Project1.git
   cd task-manager
